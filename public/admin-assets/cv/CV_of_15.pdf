- With Smartphones, It's Easier Than Ever
You can use anonymous chat apps on your phone and chat with anyone, anywhere. This allows you to communicate at any time, and it's good if you're feeling emotional right that second.
- You Can Expand Your Worldview

- Wide Selection: Airbnb hosts list many different kinds of properties-single rooms, a suite of rooms, apartments, moored yachts, houseboats, entire houses, even a castle-on the Airbnb.
- Free Listings: Hosts don’t have to pay to list their properties.
- Hosts Can Set Their Own Price: It’s up to each host to decide how much to charge per night, per week, or per month.
- Customizable Searches: Guests can search the Airbnb database—not only by date and location, but by price, type of property, amenities, and the language of the host. They can also add keywords to further narrow their search.
- Additional Services: In recent years Airbnb has expanded its offerings to include experiences and restaurants. People searching by location will see a list of experiences.
- Protections for Guests and Hosts: Airbnb holds the guest’s payment for 24 hours after check-in before releasing the funds to the host. For hosts, Airbnb’s Host Guarantee program “provides protection for up to $1,000,000 in damages to covered property in the rare event of guest damage, in eligible countries.",Quan Hoc Gioi,2021-09-11 11:31:50,2021-09-11 11:31:50,1,1
102,com.airbnb.android,The Disadvantages of Airbnb,"The Disadvantages of Airbnb
- What You See May Not Be What You Get
Booking accommodations with Airbnb is not where you have a reasonable assurance that the property will be as advertised. Individual hosts create their own listings. Check the comments of other guests who have stayed at that Airbnb property to make sure the listing is accurate.

- Potential Damage
Probably the biggest risk for hosts is that their property will be damaged. Airbnb’s Host Guarantee program, described above, provides some assurance, but it may not cover everything, such as cash, rare artwork, jewelry, and pets. 

- Added Fees
Airbnb imposes a number of additional fees (as, of course, do hotels and other lodging providers). Guests pay a guest service fee of 0% to 20% on top of the reservation fee, to cover Airbnb’s customer support and other services. Banks or credit card issuers may add fees if applicable.
And while listings are free, Airbnb charges hosts a service fee of at least 3% for each reservation, to cover the cost of processing the transaction.

- Taxes
Both hosts and guests from the European Union, Switzerland, and Norway may be subject to a value-added tax (VAT). And depending on their location, hosts may be subject to rental income taxes. To assist with U.S. tax compliance, Airbnb collects taxpayer information from hosts so they can provide an account of their earnings each year.

- It Isn’t Legal Everywhere
Before listing their properties on Airbnb, would-be hosts need to check their local zoning ordinances to make sure it’s legal to rent out their properties.

103,com.airbnb.android,How do I book a place on Airbnb?,"1. Complete your profile
Your profile should include your ID verification, especially because some hosts require guests to have a verified ID or profile photo in order to book.
2. Find the right place
When you’re searching for a place, make sure to include your dates and number of guests to get the most accurate pricing. Read reviews, descriptions, house rules, amenities, and the cancellation policy for each place to see if it’s the right fit for your trip. You can always contact the host if you have any questions about their home.
3. Book your place
Once you’ve found the right place, it’s time to book it. This is where the host’s preferred way of booking will determine how you’ll confirm your reservation.
- Instant Book
For hosts who don’t want to approve each reservation, once you tap Reserve, the next page will show Confirm and pay. Like the name suggests, you can confirm a reservation at these places right away. 
- Request to book
Many hosts prefer to approve reservations before they’re final. In this case, once you tap Reserve, the next page will show Request to book. To submit a reservation request, you’ll need to enter your payment details. Hosts have 24 hours to accept your request, and your reservation is automatically confirmed once they do. If your request is accepted, you’ll be charged in full for the reservation. 
- Pre-approvals and special offers
If you decide to contact the host to ask questions before attempting to book, the host may respond to your message by inviting you to make a reservation with either a pre-approval or special offer. A pre-approval is an invitation to finish booking for the dates and number of guests you noted in your message. A special offer gives the host the opportunity to provide special pricing, dates, and other reservation details before you book. ",Quan Hoc Gioi,2021-09-13 11:31:50,2021-09-13 11:31:50,1,1
